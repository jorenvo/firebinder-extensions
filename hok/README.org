* HoK
This is a port of HoK for Firebinder. HoK was originally written by
Masafumi Oyamada for KeySnail.
** Installation
Download firebinder_hok.js and put in in your configuration directory.
** Bindings
firebinder_hok.js provides its own default keybindings. If you wish to
change these have to modify the source file (keybinding code can be
found at the end of it).

*** Extended HoK
Just like in KeySnail extended HoK is an interactive function. The
following functions are available to type into the minibuffer.
